# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work?

## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well.

I will be using a UI kit called shadcn-vue. It has some interesting components but most importantly components that I will need for my features. I would probably use the card to help create the form and the accordion for the price list. I have not decided exactly how I would do the showcase and promotional page.

## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

I will be using Vue for my front-end framework to start off my project. I am looking into libraries like to help with the overall styling and components I will need to help save time and make the pages look more appealing. I do like using Tailwind when adding CSS but I also have a stylesheet to help better organize and make the coding look more neat.

## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).

Currently I am thinking of using MongoDB to help save the input for any information put into the application. I feel using Redux would be more reasonable to use considering I might use Vue as my front end framework. Some of the coding that it has will make it easier for me make it better for the user to interact with some of the features.

## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose?

Node will be used due to me using express to help handle my API routes. I will considering using Vue as my front end framework so I can use a library like Axios to fetch my API from the backend. It let be able to easily render for both the server and client side to manage and debug any issues.

## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

I will generate my own folders to be able to keep everything organized. There will be some node packages I would have to install in order to help my API be able to function for the users to be able to interact with the application. My controllers will be able to tell how the API will work on the page. My routes will help the user be able to navigate throughout the application.

## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

I am quite familiar with this process but it was a process that I would still needing learning on as for as doing the migrations. For now I will create my folders as needed for controllers, models, routes and etc.

## Change Order

I will be making possible changes to my front-end framework and the UI kit. I might use React because I am so familiar with the structure but I do want to stray away from that. If I choose not to then I will definitely be changing the UI kit with the Vue framework.
