# Traveling Auto Repair Company

## Application Definition Statement

_A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here._

_Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement._

This is a small owned company that travels to make repairs on cars. They want to be able to reach out to more customers within the area and surrounding areas they will travel. They sell parts online with the help of 3rd party websites but facing problems of other competitors and dependence. This application will be able to help them sell their parts without too much worry of competitors. It will allow the users to inform the company what repair they are in need for their car. It will inform users of promotions they are having throughout the seasons by subscribing and seeing them on the website.

## Target Market

_Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices._

_Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles._

This application will be for users that are looking for someone to do a car project or in need of a car repair at an affordable price. This would be used by anyone at the age of 17 and up and has to ability to drive or own a vehicle. It could be someone that love cars and wanting their old school car to be worked on. Not most companies take the time to work on car projects for long periods of time. This company travels to the customer which makes it less convenient for the customer.

## User Profile / Persona

_User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market._

Micheal Little, is 46 years old, and he owns a 1989 grand marquis. He is looking for someone to work on this car to be able to get it up and running for use on the road.

## Use Cases

_A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used._

_Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This [article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/) gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing._

The user will be able to navigate through the application to fill out a form on what kind of vehicle (make, model, and year) and what the service needed. They will be able to comment any additional information. The user will be able to see what parts the company is selling. They will be able to leave a review of the company service.

## Problem Statement

_In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research._

The company only way of communication with the customer is by the phone. The customer is not always able to get in touch with them or not all of the customers will leave a voicemail of what service is needed. Customers will get to see what kind of parts they sell and have available.

## Pain Points

_Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations._

Looking at other competition that are mobile, I see that customers do not have much form of communication with the other companies. It might be hard to reach someone at times for help which they might elsewhere for services. One other competition has a poorly designed user interface which could be frustrating for users. The users will struggle with navigating the site.

## Solution Statement

_How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?_

I plan to make the navigation easy so the user is not spending unnecessary time looking for information. Throughout the pages I will have descriptions on where to go and what to do. For when the users submit their information, it will be a pop up message letting them know that it successfully sent to company for review. On the Parts page there will be a way for the user to message someone to get more information about a product. It will notify them a message to let them know it was sent successfully.

## Competition

_What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own._

Some competing products is towing, roadside assistance, free quotes, bringing able to create an account, have a setup way of payment digitally. I need to add more products so that will bring more customers. I should think more on how the users can interact on certain pages to receive good service even without assistance from a person.

## Features & Functionality

_Define key features and functionality intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key items should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points._

_A good way to identify a Key Feature is to use the phrase 'In order to [solve this problem] I need to [do this]'. For example, 'In order to listen to music while I workout I need to be able to create a playlist'._

_Features and functionality should be prioritized based on their importance to the user. This will help you focus on the most important features first and then add additional features as time allows._

Some key features will be a list of prices for the user to be able to know the cost of service. There will be a form to help the user provide information on what type of service is needed. On the showcase page there will be a way for users to like and comment on the work that is shown. For the product page there be a way for the user to comment or message for which product they have interest and what more information.

## Integrations

_Use of an API is expected. This can be 3rd party APIs, your own API, or a combination of data sets. Identify which integrations are planned for and outline how you will use them transformatively. For 3rd party APIs provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service._

I will be practicing building my own API using Express end points with some data integration using MongoDB.
